                Historical remarks
            </h3>
            <p>
                The idea of this competition as a motivation booster traces back to the very beginning of the Corona crisis. 
                When streets where empty and our loved crags in Ötztal and Zillertal seemed out of reach, people rediscovered 
                the beauty of our local rock faces. What in this time started as a little fun focused event of a small group 
                of friends at our jewel, the Höttinger Steinbruch, now evolved to this website. After long nights, several 
                thousand lines of code and an undoubtedly unhealthy amount of coffee, we are proud to finally give this 
                website its test run!
            </p>

            <h3>
                The competition
            </h3>
            <p>
                The rules of the competition are fairly simple. However, rather than focus this event on climbing the 
                hardest routes and being the toughest son/doughter of a gun out here, we want to encourage people to push
                their limits together and grow as a team. To give this mindset fertile ground, this event shall not honor 
                the most and hardest sends in least tries, but reward those of you that persue their goal instead.
            </p>
            <p>
                To join this event, you just got to <a href="">sign up</a> and start climbing! The registration of your
                achieved sents works in a session-based system. When logged in, there is an active session element on 
                your main page. It yields all th functionality to start your session, register your goes and finish it 
                whenever you are done! Alternatively, for those folks with a good set of memory, it is also possible to
                register the session afterwards.
            </p>
            <p>
                While having an active session, it is possible to add goes in the routes included in this event. Such a 
                go contains the number of falls as well as information on whether it got sent. It is possible to register 
                both lead and toprope sents. Concering the number of falls, there clearly is a margin of discretion. However,
                since this is all about having fun, we encourage everybody to enter as fall whatever they experience as such.
                Just have fun and don't bother.
            </p>
            <p>
                In the end of the competition, the data will be automatically evaluated. As a round-up, there will be a 
                little get-together to praise the sun all together and to honor some achievements. Date and location will
                be anounced during the competition.

            <h3>Some final words</h3>
            <p>
                What started of as a little toy project to become familiar with some tools of web development ultimately 
                became this little website over the last months. A lot of love and work were spent on this project, but 
                it still is far from perfect. There will be further developement whenever I got spare time and the gusto
                to spend it for the community. So if anybody has some comments, bugs to report or ideas to improve this
                little piece of art, don't hesitate to let me know!
            </p>
            <p>
                Celebrate the positivity and have fun! </br> Josh
